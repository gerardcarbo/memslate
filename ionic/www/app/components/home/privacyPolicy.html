    <div class='innerText'>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
      The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates
      websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website
      stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
